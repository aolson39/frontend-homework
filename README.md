# Weather App

This app was created using the Open Weather free api avaialble here: https://openweathermap.org/api. 

This app provides a user interface to enter in zip codes and see the current weather forecast for the area such as current temperature, high/low for the day and a weather description. 

Users can also toggle additional weather information such as Wind Speed, Humidity, Pressure, Sunrise and Sunset times.

The default location is New York City, NY, US which can be changed in the search bar.

OpenWeather API requires payment info for 7 day forecast so it has been omitted from this project.
